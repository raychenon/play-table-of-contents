# Introduction

[Web based table of contents generator](https://tableofcontents.herokuapp.com)

There are plenty of markdown table of contents generators on github, but the installation of the dependencies is a lot of overhead for an occasional activity. That's the idea of this web app. 

In addition, it is a nice tutorial on Scala :smile:
